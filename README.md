## Hi there 👋

I'm Benjamin Rackham, a Research Scientist at MIT working at the intersection of stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.

### 🔭 Current Projects
- [**Pandora SmallSat Mission**](https://github.com/PandoraMission) – I lead efforts to correct stellar contamination in exoplanet transmission spectra.
- [**SPECULOOS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECULOOS) – I lead the Target Characterization Working Group, focused on understanding nearby ultracool dwarfs that could potentially host habitable exoplanets.
- **HST & JWST Legacy Archival Programs** – I am the PI of [The HST Stellar Treasure Trove](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023hst..prop17551R/abstract) and [Eyes on the Stars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024jwst.prop.5370R/abstract), two Legacy Archival Programs studying stellar photospheric heterogeneity in transit observations and its impact on transmission spectroscopy.
- [**speclib**](https://github.com/brackham/speclib) – Lead developer for a Python package for stellar spectral analysis and modeling.
